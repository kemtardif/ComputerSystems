/*
If the innermost track has radius x*r and the number of bits per track N is 
a function of the circumference, we can suppose N to be linear in x*r.

The number of tracks is a function of r*[1 - x], so that capacitity can be approximated
as linear in r*r*x*[1 - x]. The derivative is zero for x = 1/2
